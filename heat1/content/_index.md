Wading in the WCAG Waters: First Steps Toward Facilitating Accessibility Change at your Institution

By Michele Bromley, IT Accessibility Coordinator, Portland State University

Abstract

The necessity for working toward more inclusive, accessible digital spaces on our college campuses is becoming increasingly urgent. Legal considerations notwithstanding, there are ethical and practical imperatives for ensuring that digital resources and environments are as accessible and usable as possible for all users. But where do we begin? How can individuals act as catalysts for institutional change when that change requires community, investment, policy, and resource development? This presentation will outline first steps toward real accessibility change and provide an introduction to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that can bring that reality closer.


Learning Outcomes

1. Participants will review the basics associated with digital accessibility and the international standards that define it.
2. Participants will learn methods and messaging for engaging high-level stakeholders in institutional accessibility development.
3. Participants will explore strategies for building the communities, resources, and workflows necessary for real accessibility growth.
