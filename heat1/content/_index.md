### Accessibility in Procurement: How to Read a VPAT

April 27th, 2021 11am â€“ noon via Zoom

[RSVP](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEtd-qhqTgvGdKtGcMmVat4pJpnF57guTRm)

Anyone who makes IT procurement decisions is assuming risk on behalf of their library, university, or organization. As the risk owner, you must take steps to ensure the product or service you're procuring is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. How do you do that? A standard form used by IT vendors to document their level of accessibility is the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). This session will explore VPATs in detail and provide guidance on how to read them, and what you can learn from them, without being an accessibility expert.
