### Accessibility in Procurement: How to Read a VPAT

#### April 27th, 2021 11am – noon via Zoom
[RSVP](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEtd-qhqTgvGdKtGcMmVat4pJpnF57guTRm) Required

[Slides](/images/procurement-readingvpat.pptx)

Anyone who makes IT procurement decisions is assuming risk on behalf of their library, university, or organization. As the risk owner, you must take steps to ensure the product or service you're procuring is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. How do you do that? A standard form used by IT vendors to document their level of accessibility is the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). This session will explore VPATs in detail and provide guidance on how to read them, and what you can learn from them, without being an accessibility expert.

### Creating inclusive classroom spaces in which students thrive
#### June 9 2021, 11am – noon via Zoom
[RSVP](https://whitman.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIpcO2pqTMsE9EHYNutonJL8F1d0cYFDhAE) Required

#### Presenter
Kathryn Oleson, 
Dean of the Faculty and Professor of Psychology

Reed College

#### Webinar Description
This webinar focuses on ways to support faculty and students’ classroom experiences in higher education. I consider students’ backgrounds, including class, race, disability, and gender, and center primary needs (competence, autonomy, belonging) and concerns (e.g., self doubt about ability, impostor feelings, and stereotype threat) that students bring to the classroom. I then draw on universally-designed learning in combination with educational design rooted in social justice and multiculturalism to describe ways to design in-person and online spaces in which students flourish academically. I encourage webinar participants to reflect on their own approaches and think through how these ideas are most productively applied to their institutions.
