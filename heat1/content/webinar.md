##### Description
Institutions often wrestle with selecting and supporting solutions that not only support learning, but are effective, affordable, accessible and easy to integrate with current processes. The modern classroom and professional development environments demand that we use available tools to support a learning style that is active, inclusive and learner-centered. Enter: Universal Design for Learning (UDL). In this presentation we’ll learn of UDL emergence from Universal Design (UD); how to integrate UDL principles into teaching, training or presenting; provide guidance on how accessibility and UDL work together and explore practical application examples.  

##### Learning Outcomes
At the end of this presentation, learners will be able to:
* Identify Universal Design principles
* Describe Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
* Apply UDL guidelines into teaching and learning scenarios

[Accessibility Testing: Training for Libraries Staff](https://nwheat.org/documents/Accessibility%20Testing%20Training%20for%20Libraries%20Staff.pdf)

Andy Andrews, UW Libraries Accessibility Coordinator
#### Description
The UW Libraries is committed to providing equitable access to digital library resources. With the help of UW-IT’s Assistive Technology Services a small group of library staff created materials to facilitate workshops to train Libraries staff on how to evaluate and test online resources and applications to ensure they are accessible to patrons with disabilities. This presentation will briefly cover the process UW Libraries went through in creating our materials for audit basics, issue logging, and report writing. I will also discuss the value of sharing testing results for our patrons, other institutions, and vendors.

#### Description
The User Testing Toolkit was created by the User Testing Toolkit Project Group (UTTPG) under the Orbis Cascade Alliance Discovery & User Experience (DUX) Team in 2018 to support member interest in performing user testing.  In this presentation I will show some of the aspects of the toolkit I find to be the most useful, including the FAQ which points to resources and how-tos, sample documents, and a testing overview. I also encourage the audience to reach out if there are resources they want to recommend or sample documents they can contribute to build the toolkit further. The newly formed DUX Accessibility Group is currently building an accessibility toolkit and I will give a very brief update on its progress.

Abstract

The necessity for working toward more inclusive, accessible digital spaces on our college campuses is becoming increasingly urgent. Legal considerations notwithstanding, there are ethical and practical imperatives for ensuring that digital resources and environments are as accessible and usable as possible for all users. But where do we begin? How can individuals act as catalysts for institutional change when that change requires community, investment, policy, and resource development? This presentation will outline first steps toward real accessibility change and provide an introduction to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that can bring that reality closer.

Learning Outcomes
1. Participants will review the basics associated with digital accessibility and the international standards that define it.
2. Participants will learn methods and messaging for engaging high-level stakeholders in institutional accessibility development.
3. Participants will explore strategies for building the communities, resources, and workflows necessary for real accessibility growth.
