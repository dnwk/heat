Anyone who makes IT procurement decisions is assuming risk on behalf of their library, university, or organization. As the risk owner, you must take steps to ensure the product or service you&amp;rsquo;re procuring is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. How do you do that? A standard form used by IT vendors to document their level of accessibility is the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). This session will explore VPATs in detail and provide guidance on how to read them, and what you can learn from them, without being an accessibility expert.</description>

Presenter Michele Bromley, IT Accessibility Coordinator, Portland State University
Abstract The necessity for working toward more inclusive, accessible digital spaces on our college campuses is becoming increasingly urgent. Legal considerations notwithstanding, there are ethical and practical imperatives for ensuring that digital resources and environments are as accessible and usable as possible for all users. But where do we begin? How can individuals act as catalysts for institutional change when that change requires community, investment, policy, and resource development?</description>
